# Instructions : Air Management System
# Your goal is to build an airplanes traffic management system.
# Details
# Your program should rely on four classes: Airline, Airplane, Flight and Airport.

# Consider every plane can fly only once per day.

# The Airline Class
# Attributes:

# id (str) A two letters code
# name (str)
# planes : A list of Airplanes belonging to this airline (see below the Airplane class)
# This class has no methods

# The Airplane Class
# Attributes:

# id (int)
# current_location : The Airport where the airplane is currently located (see below the Airport class)
# company : The airline this airplane belongs to (see above the Airline class)
# next_flights : The list of Flights. Every future flights of the airplane, this list should always be sorted by datetime. (see below the Flight class)

# Methods:

# fly(self, destination): Make the airplane take off and land if a flight is scheduled for this destination (see below the Flight class)
# location_on_date(self, date): Returns where the plane will be on this date
# available_on_date(self, date, location) : Returns True if the plane can fly from this location on this date (it can fly if it is in this location on this date and if it doesnâ€™t already have a flight planned).

# The Flight Class
# Attributes:

# date : datetime.Date
# destination : The destination airport. (see below the Airport class)
# origin : The departure airport. (see below the Airport class)
# plane : The plane used during this flight. (see above the Airplane class)
# id (str) : The ID is an encoded string composed of the destination, the airlines code and the date.
# Methods:

# Those methods are here only to update the rest of the system:

# take_off(self)
# land(self) : change the location of the plane when it reaches its destination

# The Airport Class
# Attributes:

# city : (str) The code of the city where the airport is located
# planes : The list of every plane that is currently in this airport. (see above the Airplane class)
# scheduled_departures : The list of flight - Every future flight from this airport, sorted by date. (see above the Flight class)
# scheduled_arrivals : The list of flight - Every future flight that will arrive to this airport, sorted by date. (see above the Flight class)

# Methods:

# schedule_flight(self, destination, datetime) :
# finds an available airplane from an airline, that serves the departure and the destination
# schedule the airplane for the flight
# info(self, start_date, end_date) : Displays every scheduled flight from start_date to end_date.

# You are free to add any class/method/attribute to your code, be sure to document everything you write.

# Write a small code to test your program.
